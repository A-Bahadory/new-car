Dear FE Admissions Team,
I am writing to confirm my preferred course for my application to UCB. I have carefully considered my options and would like to pursue [Computer Science Level 3].
I understand that the deadline to confirm my preferred course is 5pm on Friday, 16th June 2023. I assure you that I will meet this deadline and provide any necessary information promptly.
Thank you for your assistance in removing any duplicate applications from the system. Should there be a change in my preferred course, I will notify you immediately at FEAdmissions@ucb.ac.uk.
I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to the progress of my application.
Kind regards,!
